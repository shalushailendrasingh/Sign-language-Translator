# Automatic Indian Sign Language Translator

## Overview

The **Automatic Indian Sign Language Translator** is a solution designed to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and deaf communities in India. This system converts English and Hindi speech into Indian Sign Language (ISL) visuals, including images, GIFs, and 3D animated avatars. By offering real-time, seamless translation, it improves communication for deaf individuals, educators, and interpreters.

## Key Features

* **Real-Time Translation:** Converts speech from English or Hindi into ISL visuals in real-time, facilitating immediate communication.
* **3D/Animated Avatars:** Engaging 3D avatars demonstrate ISL gestures, offering dynamic and interactive communication.
* **Customizable Interface:** Users can adjust the font size, select languages, and access tutorials for improved usability.
* **Freemium Revenue Model:** Includes both free and premium features, with potential for institutional partnerships.

## Uniqueness

* **Targeted for ISL:** Specifically designed for Indian Sign Language, addressing a gap in the Indian market.
* **Real-Time Translation with 3D Avatars:** Unlike existing systems, our solution offers dynamic, engaging visuals and real-time translation.
* **Advanced NLP and Machine Learning:** Ensures accurate and context-aware speech-to-sign interpretation for better accessibility.

## Existing System

While many existing solutions focus on American Sign Language (ASL), the Indian market lacks robust tools for ISL. Most ISL tools offer basic word-by-word translations, which often miss the nuances and full complexity of ISL. Additionally, current systems typically lack real-time translation and rely on outdated or incomplete datasets, limiting their usability for daily communication.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** Python \& Unity
* **Backend:** Python
* **Machine Learning:** Deep Neural Networks
* **Animations:** Unity
* **Programming Languages:** Python, C#

## Use Cases

1. **Input Capture:** Users can provide video, audio, or text in English or Hindi, with videos converted to audio and then to text.
2. **Text Processing:** Hindi text is translated into English for processing.
3. **ISL Gesture Matching:** The system matches the translated text with ISL gestures from the database.
4. **Real-Time Output:** Generates 3D avatars, GIFs, or videos for ISL gestures in real-time.
5. **Fallback for Unavailable Phrases:** If no exact match is found, the system provides a word-by-word ISL translation.

## System Analysis

* **Translation Accuracy:** Measures how well speech is converted to ISL gestures.
* **Real-Time Efficiency:** Monitors the speed and responsiveness of the translation process.
* **User Interaction:** Tracks how users engage with 3D avatars and ISL visuals.
* **Database Coverage:** Evaluates the completeness of the ISL gesture database.

## Dependencies

* **Speech-to-Text API:** Google or Azure API for converting audio input to text in real-time.
* **3D Animation Libraries:** Unity and Blender for generating ISL gestures and avatars in the app.
